Right now, supports only local file-system and this software needs to be running on the same JVM as the clients (can overcome it using network communication - i guess the implementation must be simple). <br /> -JCA compliant, so can plug into any J2EE server implementation. J2EE applications will view it as a JCA Resource Adapter. <br /> -Standalone Java applications can also be clients,<br /> -Enables MDBs to listen for changes for the files they are interested in. Such file state changes are abstracted as &quot;messages&quot; and delivered to the interested MDBs. <br /> -Fulfills other expectations from transactional system : deadlock detection, concurrency control, crash-recovery, transaction timing-out. <br /> -Supports both local and XA transactions. <br /> ____________________________________________<br /> <br /> Here is the current status from testing: <br /> <br /> -has been tested against some tests of simple to medium complexity. <br /> -i feel a need to test it further with more and more rigorous tests, because being a transactional system, the software will be handed-over critical data and so need to create as much trust as it can.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Participation:</h3> <p>This project may provide an opportunity for developers to participate in a    variety of ways.
